# WebEng-Assignment-2

In this project I've created a backend system for a blogging platform using Express.js and MongoDB. The goal is to develop a RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, manage user accounts, and implement basic social features. It's essentially the backend of a blogging platform where users can also interact with other users' posts by liking, commenting, and following other bloggers.
This was a very interesting project that helped me gain a decent amount of experience in backend development.
